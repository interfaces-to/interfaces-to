# Build a Slackbot with üêô Interfaces

You can build a Slackbot with üêô Interfaces, OpenAI and the Slack SDK in minutes. This example demonstrates how to build a Slackbot that can interact with users by listening for messages and responding with a message generated by OpenAI's gpt-4o.

## Setup

Get started by creating a new Slack app and installing it to your workspace. You can follow the instructions in the [Slack Python SDK documentation](https://slack.dev/bolt-python/getting-started) to create a new Slack app and install it to your workspace. Be sure to enable [Event Subscriptions](https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/socket-mode/) and the necessary OAuth permission scopes for your app:

* app_mentions:read
* channels:history
* channels:join
* channels:manage
* channels:read
* chat:write
* im:history
* im:read
* im:write

Create a new OpenAI API key by following the instructions in the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com). 

You can then copy the files in this folder and follow the following steps:

1. Install dependencies with `pip install interfaces-to slack_sdk openai`
2. Update your environment variables in `.env`
3. Run it with `python slackbot.py`

See [slackbot.py](slackbot.py) for the full code.

## Add more features to your Slackbot

You can add more features to your Slackbot by adding tools from üêô Interfaces. For example, it can check Airtable for relevant information by adding `Airtable` to `into.import_tools(['Slack','Airtable'])` on Line 12.
