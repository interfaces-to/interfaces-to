## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install with pip:
```bash
pip install interfaces-to
```

or

Install with poetry:
```bash
poetry add interfaces-to
```

### Usage

Turn your OpenAI completion into a fully capable agent with 3 lines of code:

```python
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ import `into`
import interfaces_to as into

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ import the OpenAI client as normal
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ add your favourite tools and set a message
agent = into.Agent().add_tools(['Slack','OpenAI']).add_messages("What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summarise and share it in an appropriate channel")

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ start the agent loop, with an OpenAI completion
while agent:
  agent.completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=agent.messages,
    tools=agent.tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
  )

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ watch the magic happen! üé©‚ú®
```

This prints the following output:
```python
[user]		  What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summ
		    arise and share it in an appropriate channel

[assistant]	  Here is a summary poem of the last messages shared in the Slack channels:
		
                In **#general**, they said with glee,
                "Atoms make up all that we see!"
                **#hello** greeted someone new,
                Joining the channel, the greetings flew.
                
                **#fun-times** loved a joke,
                On atoms that can't be broke.
                In the **#poetry** nook, atoms we praised,
                With playful rhymes, our spirits raised.
                
                **#jokes** was all about the spin,
                Electrons in a debate always win.
                And though **#welcome** remained hushed,
                **#random** laughed at atoms crushed.
                
                I'll share this poem in the **#poetry** channel.

                And though **#welcome** remained hushed,
                **#random** laughed at atoms crushed.

[assistant]	  I have shared the poem summarizing the last messages in each channel
                to the **#poetry** channel.
```

`agent.messages` is also updated with the latest messages and retains the format needed by the OpenAI SDK, so you can continue the adventure and build more complex applications.

You can run this example in [this Jupyter notebook](./quickstart.ipynb).

### Setting the system message

You can modify the behaviour of your agent by setting the system message.

```python
agent = into.Agent("Always talk like a pirate")
```

### Configuring tools

#### Using environment variables (Recommended for production)

Tools usually require a `token`. Tokens can always be configured by setting the relevant environment variables. e.g. for `Slack` you can set the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

If you are using environment variables, you can take advantage of `agent.add_tools` or the `into.import_tools` function to automatically configure your tools. This function will look for the relevant environment variables and configure the tools with default settings.

```python
agent.add_tools(['Slack'])
```

or

```python
tools = into.import_tools(['Slack'])
```

#### Using a `.env` file (Recommended for local development)

You can also configure your tools using a `.env` file. This is useful if you want to keep your tokens and other settings in a single file and helpful for local development.

Simply add a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following format:

```env
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-12345678-xxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Setting tokens directly in code

If you prefer to set the token directly in your code or have more control over tool settings, you can do so by passing arguments to each tool. Tokens provided in code will override any environment variables.

You can optionally restrict `functions` to only those which you need.

Here's an example of configuring the Slack tool:

```python
tools = [*into.Slack(
    token="xoxb-12345678-xxxxxxxxxx",
    functions=["send_slack_message"]
)]
```

Note that each tool is preceded by an asterisk `*` to unpack the tool's functions into a list, which the OpenAI API SDK expects.

## üì¶ Available tools

`into` comes with loads of pre-built tools to help you get started quickly. These tools are designed to be simple, powerful and flexible, and can be used in any combination to create a wide range of applications.

| Tool | Description | Functions | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Self](https://interfaces.to/tools/self) | Encourage self awareness, time awareness and logical evaluation. | `wait`, `plan`, `get_time`, `do_math` | None required. |
| [System](https://interfaces.to/tools/system) | Control the system behaviour. | `get_system_message`, `set_system_message`, `clear_system_message` | None required. |
| [OpenAI](https://interfaces.to/tools/openai) | Create completions and embeddings with the OpenAI API (Yes, that means self-prompting üî•) | `create_chat_completion`, `create_embedding` | Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable |
| [Slack](https://interfaces.to/tools/slack) | Send messages to Slack channels, create channels, list channels, and read messages | `send_slack_message`, `create_channel`, `list_channels`, `read_messages` | Uses `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable |
| [Notion](https://interfaces.to/tools/notion) | Find, read and create pages in Notion | `search_notion`, `query_notion_database`, `read_notion_page`, `create_notion_page` | Uses `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable. Databases must be explicitly shared with the integration. |
| [Airtable](https://interfaces.to/tools/airtable) | Find, read and create records in Airtable | `list_all_bases`, `get_base`, `list_base_records`, `create_base_records` | Uses `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` environment variable |
| [People Data Labs](https://interfaces.to/tools/people-data-labs) | Find information about people and companies | `find_person`, `find_company` | Uses `PDL_API_KEY` environment variable |

More tools are coming soon:

* Twilio
* GitHub
* Jira
* Discord
* and more!

See the [üõ†Ô∏è Tools Project plan](https://github.com/orgs/interfaces-to/projects/1) for more information on upcoming tools.

## üåê Experimental: Dynamic messages

`into` supports reading messages dynamically. The `messages` variable required by OpenAI SDK is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message. Each message must have a `role` key with a value of either `user` or `assistant`, and a `content` key with the message content.

You can use `agent.add_messages` or `into.read_messages` to configure dynamic messages.

```python
agent.add_messages(["What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summarise and share it in an appropriate channel"])
```

or

```python
messages = into.read_messages(["Slack"])
```

The following sources are currently supported:

| Source | Description | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Slack](https://interfaces.to/messages/slack) | Read messages from a Slack channel where your app is mentioned or in direct messages | Requires `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable. Socket Mode must be enabled with the appropriate events. |
| [Ngrok](https://interfaces.to/messages/ngrok) | Receive POST /message body using Ngrok. Useful for testing webhooks locally. | Requires `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` environment variable. |
| [FastAPI](https://interfaces.to/messages/fastapi) | Receive POST /message body on Port 8080 with FastAPI. | None required. |
| [Gradio](https://interfaces.to/messages/gradio) | Receive messages from Gradio's ChatInterface. | None required. |
| [CLI](https://interfaces.to/messages/cli) | Read messages from the command line. For use in scripts executed on the command line or with running `into` itself (see below). | None required. |

See the [üí¨ Messages Project plan](https://github.com/orgs/interfaces-to/projects/3) for more information on upcoming tools.

### Limitations

* Currently only one source can be configured at a time.
* History is not retained between the resolution of messages, however `into` is able to simulate message history by calling the Slack `read_messages` tool if equipped with `into.import_tools(['Slack'])`. 

## üìü Experimental: CLI Support

`into` supports running tools from the command line. This is useful when `CLI` is the message source, allowing you to run as a standalone application.

By default this uses OpenAI and requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

You can install `into` with the CLI support by running:

```bash
pipx ensurepath
pipx install interfaces_to
```

Since `pipx` installs packages in an isolated environment, you may need to add the dependencies for the tools you want to use. To do this for the Slack tool, you can do this at install time by running:

```bash
pipx install interfaces_to[slack]
```

If you want to use additional tools after install, you can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pipx inject interfaces_to ngrok
```

Then you can run `into` with the following command:

```bash
into --tools=Slack "What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summarise and share it in an appropriate channel"
```

or run it with poetry by cloning this repository:

```bash
poetry install
```
  
Then you can run `into` with the following command:
  
  ```bash
poetry run into --tools=Slack "What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summarise and share it in an appropriate channel"
```

You can also pipe messages to `into`, which will output JSON for manipulation in other tools like `jq`:

```bash
echo "What was the last thing said in each slack channel? Write a 5 line poem to summarise and share it in an appropriate channel" | into --tools=Slack
```

### Usage

* `--help` - Show help message.
* `--tools` - A comma-separated list of tools to import. e.g. `--tools=Slack,OpenAI`
* `--messages` - A comma-separated list of message sources to import. e.g. `--messages=Slack,CLI`
* `--model` - The model to use for completions. e.g. `--model=gpt-4o`
* `--api-key` - The OpenAI API key to use for completions. e.g. `--api-key=sk-12345678`
* `--endpoint` - The endpoint to use for completions. e.g. `--endpoint=https://myendpoint`
* `--azure` - Use Azure functions for completions. e.g. `--azure`
* `[message]` - The message to send to the tools when `--messages=CLI` is set. This can passed in via stdin or as the last argument. When provided, `into` will run the tools and output the result as JSON to stdout.

### Use with Azure OpenAI

You can use `into` with Azure OpenAI by setting the flags below.

```bash
into --tools=Slack --azure --endpoint=https://azure-endpoint --model=gpt-4o --api-key=sk-12345678 "summarise the last messages in each slack channel"
```

### Use with open source models via Ollama

You can use `into` with open source models via Ollama by setting the flags below. **Important:** The model MUST support function calling. Full list of compatible models can be found [here](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).

```bash
into --tools=Slack --endpoint=http://localhost:11434/v1 --model=llama3.1:8b "what is the time?"
```
